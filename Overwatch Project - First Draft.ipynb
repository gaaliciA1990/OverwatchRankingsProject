    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Overwatch Origins Edition was released on May of 2016 for Windows, PS4 and Xbox One, by Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard is known for their Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) and stragety based games, like World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm, and StraCraft. Overwatch features a team based first-person shooter with 26 characters split between four group classifications; Offense, Defense, Tanks, and Support. The structure of the game is based on team work to capture objectives and\n",
    "transport cargo objectives, or hold capture points. The games design has a variety of modes to choose from, depending on the players preferred gaming style; Arcade mode, which presents challenges for a player to play solo or as a team, Quickplay mode, where players are queued with other players in non-ranked matches for the maps objectives, and Competitive mode, where players are queued with other players based on skill rating for map objectives and is only available during seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's release, the game has grown in popularity, with the most recent player count at 35 million in October of 2017, according to statista.com (2017) and pcgamesn.com (2017). Overwatch has entered into the esports community with the launch of Overwatch League (overwatchleague.com/en-us/) in 2018, showcasing the top competitive players in the Overwatch community. The competitive players are determined through the games Skill Rating system in Competitive matches, ranging from 1 to 4000+ (overwatch.gamepedia.com/Competitive_Play), with Bronze being the lowest and Grand Master being the highest (outside of the top 500 for the region).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the demomstrated interest from the gaming community on Overwatch League, at 10 million viewers in the League's first week (dotesports.com/overwatch/news/overwatch-league-10-million-viewers-20274), Competitive Overwatch is a popular game mode. As a regular gamer, and an Overwatch fan, I regularly participate in Competitive matches, and I am working to rise in the ranks with each passing season. During my time playing Overwatch Competitive, I have tried to maintain a balance in the number of characters I play well, with the hope this will help me raise my Skill Rating. The Skill Rating system has been a topic in numerous gaming threads on reddit and Overwatch forums, as the community tries to determine the best way to rise in the ranks. My goal is to determine what is the best way to increase a player's skill rating, thus their Competitive Rank, by analyzing player's Overwatch console data."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does having the flexibility to play 2-3 characters increase your chances of a higher Skill Rating (SR), or should a player focus on 1 character and master them for a higher SR? Can I predict a player's SR from the number of characters they have played, by analyzing the total number of games played and the total wins/loss/ties for each character, from a span of three seasons? **\n",

    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that having the flexibilty to play 2-3 characters, well, provides a player the ability to adapt to a competitive match's team composition by filling in the needed group classification for that match. By creating a balanced team, the chances of winning the match increases, thus providing the player with a higher SR through out their competitive season.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing a player's game data, I will be able to predict their future seasons SR based on the number of characters they've played and the total games played with each character over a season. \n"
