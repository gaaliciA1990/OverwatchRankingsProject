# Overwatch Competitive Ranking Project

## Objective
This will be an analysis of Overwatch Competitive ranking. An indept anlysis will be conducted into the correlation of having multiple characters as a "main" (most played character(s)) on a player's competitive ranking. The goal is to create a predictive model for competitive ranking based on the last three (3) competitive seasons' data, to determine a player's chance of attaining a higher Skill Rating (SR) based on the number of characters played. A players top characters will be determined using their win/loss/tie statistics for each season. 


## Hypothesis
I believe the more flexible a player is in their competitive match, the higher chance they have of attaining a higher SR. My hypothesis is, a player who "mains" 2-3 characters, as opposed to 1 or more than 3, has a higher flexibility in adapting to a competitive team match, and performing better (higher wins), thus resulting in a higher SR.
